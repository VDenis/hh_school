## Tasks:

### 1. Median
Given two sorted numeric array of the same length N. Find the median of the numerical array of length 2N, containing all the numbers of the two data sets. 

```
Sample input: 
1 2 3 4 
1 4 5 6 

Example output: 
3.5 
```

### 2. Conversion
We call the transformation of an integer n the use of one of the following: 

* n -> n + 1 
* n -> n + 2 
* n -> 2n 

Write a program that, given the numbers n and m defines the length of the shortest sequence of transformations, which translates into a number n integer m.

Where n and m: (0 <= n <= m <= 10 ^ 15). 

```
Example: 
n = 5, m = 13 

Answer: 3
